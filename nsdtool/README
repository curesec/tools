nsdtool  - netgear switch discovery tool
========================================

-= Abstract =-

This is a toolset of scripts used for discovering of netgear switches in
local networks. The tool consists of some extra features like bruteforce
and setting a new password. Netgear has its own protocol called NSDP Netgear Switch
Discovery Protocol, which is humbly implemented to support security
tests on the commandline and not being bound to the delivered tools by Netgear.
Find more information about the Netgear Switch Discovery Protocol here:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netgear_NSDP

-= Usage =-

Define your interface and possible delay in the config.ini.

# cat config.ini 
[NSDP]
SourcePort = 63323				<--- nsdp source
DestPort = 63324				<--- nsdp dest
Interface = eth0				<--- your network interface
DestIP = 255.255.255.255		
Delay = 0.01					<--- interval delay

-= How to find switches supporting the NSDP? =-

Set the nsdtool in shell one in sniffer mode
# ./main.py -s

Set the nsdtool in shell two in discovery mode
# ./main.py -d -t 192.168.1.0/24

If a Netgear device supporting the protocol was found the output on the
sniffer side looks sort like this:

Version : 4 IP Header Length : 5 TTL : 64 Protocol : 17 Source Address :
192.168.1.2 Destination Address : 192.168.1.3
Source Port : 63324 Dest Port : 63323 Length : 143 Checksum : 35212
protocol: NSDP
device: GS100
mac: 31:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
firmware version: 5.3.2
default gateway: 192.168.1.1
switch ip: 192.168.1.2
subnet mask: 255.255.255.0

-= Set a new password =-

# ./main.py -m 31:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX -sp -cp currentpassword -np mynewpassword

-= Bruteforce the password =-

# ./main.py -m 31:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX -bf passwords.txt -np mynewpassword

Attention, for bruteforcing the -np password is used as well. This means for the bruteforce mechanism new password option is used.
You have to set the old pw after you cracked it by your own.

-= Reboot the device =-
# ./main.py -m 31:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX -r -p currentpassword
